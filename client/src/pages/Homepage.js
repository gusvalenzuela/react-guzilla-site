            Since an adolescent, I have been fascinated with technology, computers, and the world wide web. I made
            static webpages in my youth and even got to deploy some flash-centric wonders. Over the years my love of
            technology and computers only grew more powerful - occassionally doing activites on FreeCodeCamp and taking
            computer science courses at the local community college.
            Most recently I have been attending a Coding Bootcamp, by Trilogy/UC Davis Continuing Education, on the path to
        becoming a full stack web developer. I hope to continue to grow as a web developer and as a person.</p>

            hear from you! Have a wonderful day =] </p>
